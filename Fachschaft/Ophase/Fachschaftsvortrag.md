Twice a year at the beginning of each Semester we organize an Ophase where many many people come together to provide each one of you the best possible beginning into your Study at our TU Darmstadt. The Ophase contains many different program points from Breakfast over talks up to your Master BBQ and a City Tour through Darmstadt. Some of you may have wondered since when our master Students are so young, this is because they most probably are not master students but bachelor students. Thats because in Wintersemesters we organize two different Ophasen, one for you and one for our bachelor newcomers. Take this opportunity and get to meet your fellow students
